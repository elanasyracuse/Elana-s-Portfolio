        <!-- About -->
        <article id="about">
          <h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm a software engineer who's found my passion at the intersection of AI, accessibility, and healthcare technology.</p>
<br><p>At Upstate Medical University, I'm working on something I care deeply about and that is making sure everyone can access healthcare information online, regardless of their abilities. I built an AI pipeline using Azure Vision AI and Python that generates alt text for images across the hospital's websites, solving a backlog of over 40,000 images that were inaccessible to screen reader users. It's been incredible to see how automation can tackle problems at scale while directly improving patients' digital experiences.</p>
<br><p>What excites me most is using technology to solve real healthcare challenges.
  I've worked on automated testing for a bilingual HIV support platform, making sure Spanish speaking patients can access critical resources 
  in their language. I built a RAG powered chatbot to help students navigate complex medical course information more easily. 
  And I've spent countless hours converting PDFs into accessible formats so that people using keyboards or screen readers can independently 
  navigate healthcare websites. Each project taught me something new about how thoughtful engineering directly impacts people's ability 
  to access care and information.</p>
<br><p>I came to this field through a somewhat winding path, I started in enterprise QA at Larsen & Toubro Infotech testing financial systems,
  and even spent time analyzing athlete movement data in rural India. Those experiences taught me to be detail oriented, resourceful, and always think about the end user. Now at Syracuse University pursuing my MS in Information Management, I'm combining everything I've learned with new skills in AI and accessibility.</p>
<br><p>I genuinely believe healthcare technology should work seamlessly for everyone, and I'm excited to keep learning, building, and contributing to that goal. I love the problem solving aspect of this work, and I'm energized by teams that care as much about impact as they do about innovation.</p>

  <h3>Software Engineer — Intern</h3>
  <p class="exp-meta"><em>Upstate Medical University · Syracuse, NY · May 2025 – Present</em></p>
  <p><strong>What I Walked Into:</strong> I'll be honest! before this internship, I knew accessibility was important, but I'd never really worked in it. My first week, I learned how patients using screen readers and keyboards found it difficult to access services on our websites, and it just clicked for me,these weren't just compliance checkboxes, these were real barriers for people trying to access information and services.</p>
  <p><strong>What I Got to Do:</strong> I got to build something I'd never tried before, an AI-powered pipeline using Azure Vision AI to auto-generate alt text. It was my first time working with Azure's AI services, learning to integrate it with Python was challenging and exciting. I loved trying to figure out how to make AI generate contextually appropriate descriptions, not just generic ones. I enjoyed the hands-on work too, the time I spent converting PDFs to accessible HTML, learning Cascade CMS, and using tools like AXE and WAVE to audit websites. Working with the web team taught me that accessibility work is this beautiful mix of automation and human judgment and you need both.</p>
  <p><strong>What Stuck With Me:</strong> I learned that accessibility is deeply creative work. Every website has different needs, and I got better at thinking from users' perspectives, would this alt text actually help someone? Is this navigation logical with just a keyboard?</p>
  <p><strong>The biggest takeaway?</strong> I discovered I really love work that has immediate, tangible impact. When we cleared those backlogs and I could see the before/after difference in accessibility scores, it felt meaningful. Plus, the team was incredibly supportive, they taught me so much about web governance and compliance standards.</p>

<section class="exp-card">
  <h3>Quality Assurance Coordinator</h3>
  <p class="exp-meta"><em>Positive People (HIV Social Platform) · Syracuse, NY · Remote · [Start Date] – Present</em></p>
  <p><strong>Joining a Mission Driven Team:</strong> I joined Positive People, an HIV support social platform, while pursuing my graduate studies. This was my first experience coordinating QA operations across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, web), and I was drawn to the meaningful impact of helping a vulnerable community access safe, anonymous social support. The small team structure meant I could make real contributions from day one.</p>
  <p><strong>What I Worked On:</strong> I managed the entire QA pipeline using Jira, coordinating testing efforts between team members and tracking bugs from discovery through production deployment. I tested features across all three platforms, working directly with our developer to clarify issues and verify fixes. One major project involved supporting our internationalization initiative. I used Claude AI to translate hundreds of static UI elements from English to Spanish, ensuring the platform could serve Spanish speaking users. This was not just about translation accuracy; I had to consider how the app would handle longer Spanish phrases, maintain consistency across platforms, and preserve the anonymous, trustworthy feel that is so critical for HIV positive users. I also built comprehensive QA testing documentation from scratch, creating scripts that detailed expected system behavior for every feature. This was crucial because the platform handles sensitive health information, and any bug could erode user trust. I coordinated deployment schedules with our backend team, ensuring smooth rollouts and immediate testing after major updates.</p>
  <p><strong>What I Took Away:</strong> This role taught me how to balance technical precision with empathy for end users. Testing is not just about finding bugs; it is about understanding who will use the feature and what failure means for them. I learned to manage projects across distributed teams, communicate technical issues clearly to non technical stakeholders, and build testing infrastructure that others can maintain. Working on bilingual features showed me how technology choices (like UI layouts and character limits) intersect with cultural considerations. Most importantly, I discovered I thrive when my technical work directly helps people. Knowing that my QA work helps HIV positive individuals connect safely and anonymously gives my daily work real purpose.</p>

  <h3>Sports Data Analyst</h3>
  <p class="exp-meta"><em>Lonar Central Public School · Mumbai, India · Dec 2022 – Mar 2024</em></p>
  <p><strong>How This Even Happened:</strong> This one's a bit different! After leaving my software job in Mumbai, I moved back home and started volunteering at a local athletics academy in a rural area. I wasn't planning to make it a "tech role," but when the coaches learned about my background, they got curious—could data actually help these kids improve? I was intrigued. I'd never worked with sports analytics before, and honestly, I was ready for something hands-on and community-focused after corporate life.</p>
  <p><strong>What I Figured Out:</strong> I started using Kinovea, this free motion analysis software, to record and analyze athletes' running form. It was fascinating learning a completely new domain—understanding biomechanics, what makes good sprinting form, how tiny adjustments in angle or stride can change speed. I worked with about 40 athletes, and seeing them improve by understanding their own movement data was incredible. The coolest part? I got to be resourceful in ways I'd never been before. When we needed equipment we couldn't afford, I designed custom training tools with local materials. When I realized the program needed better visibility to get funding, I taught myself enough HTML and CSS to build a simple portfolio website showcasing the athletes' progress. That website actually helped us secure some funding, which felt amazing.</p>
  <p><strong>What This Taught Me:</strong> This experience reminded me that technical skills are most powerful when you combine them with genuine curiosity and a willingness to learn new domains. I wasn't an expert in sports science, but I was willing to learn, ask questions, and collaborate with people who were experts. It also taught me that some of my best work happens when I care deeply about the people I'm helping. Those athletes and coaches were so dedicated, and being part of their journey was one of the most fulfilling things I've done. It showed me I want my career to involve work that means something to real communities.</p>

  <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
  <p class="exp-meta"><em>Larsen and Toubro Infotech · Mumbai, India · Aug 2020 – Aug 2021</em></p>
  <p><strong>My First Real Job:</strong> This was my first role after graduating—I was excited, nervous, and eager to prove myself! I joined as a Software Engineer working on a Client Risk Analysis Portal for a financial services client. It was a big, established company, very different from what I'm doing now, but it taught me so many fundamentals.</p>
  <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> I dove into test automation using Selenium and Java, which was challenging at first. I was writing and executing test cases, learning PL/SQL to validate database operations, and figuring out how all the pieces of a large enterprise application fit together. One thing I'm proud of: I noticed our testing focused heavily on UI but didn't validate the API layer thoroughly. I proposed integrating RESTful API testing into our framework, and my team lead supported it. Seeing that idea actually improve our regression coverage taught me that even junior engineers can contribute meaningful improvements—you just have to speak up thoughtfully.</p>
  <p><strong>What Stuck:</strong> This role taught me the discipline of good QA work—attention to detail, thinking through edge cases, and understanding that every test case you write is potentially preventing a real problem down the line. I also learned how to work in a structured corporate environment—Agile ceremonies, working with cross-functional teams, documenting everything. These might sound basic, but they're foundations I still use today. Most importantly, it confirmed that I love the problem-solving aspect of software work, and it made me curious about other domains. That curiosity eventually led me to Syracuse and all these different experiences since then.</p>
